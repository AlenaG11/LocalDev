    "#### Marketing Mix Modeling: A/B Testing marketing campaigns for revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is part of a series of Marketing Mix Models.  The retail client for whom the testing was done ran multiple marketing campaigns, which in some cases resulted in noticeably different revenue. Campaigns were run for approximately the same time and were of the same duration.  The question we tried to answer was if it was truly the message (and offer) of campaigns that made some of them more compelling than others. That is, the purpose is to find out if the difference in revenue produced by two different marketing campaigns is statistically significant, i.e., not due just to random chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I tested 26 segements of customer population. The segements, reflecting geographical, demographic and financial information, were randomly split into two groups: one group was receiving offer A and another group receiving offer B. Then, to compare the differences in resulting revenues, I ran a T-test for the difference of the means."
